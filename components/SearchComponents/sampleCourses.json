    "textDescription": "Economists study human behavior using a combination of models and data. Ec 10a introduces students to economic models by using intuitive discussions, graphical analysis, and, in some cases, very basic algebra. The models study individual decision-making and markets, and range from classical approaches like supply and demand to more recent approaches that consider informational limitations and behavioral mistakes. We will also use data to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these models. The course also discusses the role that ethics and values play in people's choices and in policy discussions, including an understanding and critique of approaches like utilitarianism and libertarianism. The goal of the course is to provide students with a set of tools that will help them develop answers for themselves on how to make better choices and participate in debates on major public policy issues in areas including tax policy, inequality, discrimination and racial justice, the environment, and the economic problems associated with the COVID crisis.",

    "HU_REC_PREP": "There is no mathematics background requirement. No calculus is used in the course and the use of algebra is very limited. Ec 10a is strongly recommended in advance of Ec 10b which covers macroeconomics",
    "HU_COURSE_PREQ": "Ec 10a is the first half of an integrated sequence that continues with the study of macroeconomics in Ec 10b. Students may elect to take only the fall microeconomics course and receive four credits. This sequence is designed with two types of students in mind. For students who will never take another economics course, Ec 10a and 10b provide a self-contained training to prepare them to understand and engage with economic issues. For students who end up deciding to be Economics Concentrators, Ec 10a and 10b provide a wide-ranging introduction to the field and are required courses. The Department of Economics strongly encourages students considering concentrating in Economics to take these courses during their first year in the College. Ec 10a and 10b are not duplicative of AP Economics courses but aim to provide a broader perspective and a deeper engagement with public policy. Either Ec 10a or 10b fulfills the Social Sciences divisional distribution requirement. It is not necessary for students to take both halves of Ec 10 to fulfill this divisional requirement. Discussion sections will be held at various times throughout the day on Thursdays and Fridays. Course staff will solicit time preferences from enrolled students before making section assignments during the first week of class.",

(The Ad Board has already granted this exception for CS50; no other steps are required.) Students with other academic or athletic conflicts should email the course&#39;s heads. CS50 is ordinarily graded SAT/UNS, though students whose concentration requires letter grades should change their grading status to letter-graded by the term&#39;s fifth Monday. Students may take CS50 SAT/UNS to fulfill the Science and Engineering and Applied Science distribution requirement or the Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement, but not both. First years may take both CS50 and a freshman seminar SAT/UNS. Graduate students are welcome to cross-register for CS50.
